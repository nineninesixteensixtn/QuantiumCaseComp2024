# Thoughts
- Finalise profit statement (i.e combine revenue from applications, losses from clawbacks and expenses from campaigns)
- look at relationship between: clawbacks and:
    - Interest rate of loan
    - loan amount
    - house value
    - annual income
    - Q factors
    - What campaigns they signed up from
- Fit distribution on account closing (log rank test)
    - look at how to extend time to 18mths
    TODO:
    - Prepare data: create an array with:
        1. unique ID (application ID)
        2. time (months) it survived until (if it finished then status at final month is 0/censored )
        3.
